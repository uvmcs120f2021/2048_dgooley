### Collaboration and reused work:
I work entirely on my own for this project with the exception of peers resting my game by playing it. I used some code copied and then altered from the original "graphics starter" assignement but otherise used no other outside code. 

### Setup on Directions:
This program should be able to run directly as long as all of the graphics setups have been done. This program was made entirely in CLION. I ran this program on a windows device. Of note if you try to run this program and get an error about circle fil try creating an empty "Circle.h/.cpp" this had something to do with me copying CMake files and I wasn't sure how to fix it. 

Instructions for setting up graphic program can be found here: https://github.com/uvmcs120f2021/Graphics-Starter 
### Concepts from Class
The main concepts that I encorporated from class were input/output, graphics, event listeners, and testing. This constitude content from Modules 2 and 4. The majority of my project focused on concepts from module 4 as I was far more inspired by graphics and the majority of my work was their.
