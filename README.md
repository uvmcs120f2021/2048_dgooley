# Errors
This project is riddled with errors. Please fix all the bugs!

## Setup
Use this Guided Project template to create a new repository (see [GitHub-with-CLion](https://github.com/uvmcs120f2021/GitHub-with-CLion) repo for directions).
**Your repository must be named with the convention: Errors-netid**, where netid is your UVM NetID username.

When you first put it into CLion, the Build and Run buttons will be grayed out and unclickable. This is intentional. You will need to start fixing bugs before these buttons can be used.

Remember to commit and push frequently.

## Errors
There are three types of errors:
1. **Compiler errors** prevent your program from running. These are typically CMake or syntax errors.
1. **Runtime errors** occur while the program is running and prevent an exit code of zero. Examples of this include a non-zero exit code and an infinite loop.
1. **Logic errors** are when your program runs to completion (with exit code zero) but does not behave the way you intended. The best way to catch logic errors is through extensive testing and/or the use of the debugger.

For this project, you have been given a very broken program and it is your job to fix it. For each error you fix, log it in the table below.

## Logging Errors
Every time you fix a bug, log it in the README file here:

| Type of error (compiler, runtime, logic) | File | Description | Fix |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Example: compiler | CMakeLists.txt | "project PROJECT called with incorrect number of arguments" | Added the project name to line 2 |
